    "sentiment_prob(\"\"\"\"Early goals from Mason Mount and Pedro put Chelsea into a commanding lead over Everton which Carlo Ancelotti's men never recovered from, Chelsea made light work of Everton in a dominant victory at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. ,  The Blues took a 14th-minute lead after Mason Mount controlled Pedro's pass on the turn before firing hard and low past Jordan Pickford at the near post. ,  Soon after Pedro had got his own name on the scoresheet, racing clear of the Toffees' defence to finish past Pickford and double the advantage. , Willian then put the game beyond doubt just five minutes into the second half as he drilled a 25-yard shot into the far corner. The Brazilian then turned provider with a curling cross to the far post which Olivier Giroud tucked away, as Everton sank without trace. Here are John Cross's ratings from Stamford Bridge. Arrizabalaga 7, Back in the starting line-up, looked good. Does he have a future, after all?, Azpilicueta 6, Solid in defence, did not offer so much going forward but reliable. Rudiger 7, Rock solid, used his pace well and kept Everton’s forwards quiet. Zouma 7, Surprise pick, had an early wobble but looked strong from then on. Alonso 7, Had a good game, linked up and overlapped nicely from left back. Barkley 8, Big performance against old club. Two assists and had last laugh. Gilmour 7, When Roy Keane calls you world class, you must be special. He is. Mount 7, Well taken goal, back to his lively best before going off injured. Pedro 8, MotM. His best game for ages, well taken goal and was excellent overall. Willian 7, Electric pace, scored and dangerous. Proving Chelsea need to keep him. Giroud 7, Scored but also provided a focal point for Chelsea’s attack. Excellent. Subs, James, for Mount, 60 mins, 6, Anjorin, fo Willian, 71 mins, Broja, for Giroud, 87 mins, Pickford 7, Some good saves, Everton would have lost by double figures without him. Sidibe 4, Had a stinker, sloppy and undone. Very uncomfortable at right back. Keane 5, Got outdone by Giroud’s physical strength. Bad day at the office. Holgate 4, Horribly exposed, poor positioning and lack of pace. Nightmare. Digne 5, Has been struggling with injury and did not look at his sharpest. Bernard 4, Hooked at half time. Did get an injury, but could have been subbed anyway. Gomes 5, Given the runaround, could not get close to his Chelsea opponents. Davies 5, Subbed early after a nightmare performance where he was just chasing shadows. Sigurdsson 5, Easy to forget he was even playing. The game completely passed him by. Calvert-Lewin 5, Went clean through but fired wide with a chance to get Everton back in it. Richarlison 5, Barely had a look-in, no service and could not provide an outlet. Subs, Walcott, for Bernard, 46 mins, 5, Kean, for Davies, 57 mins, 5, Gordon, for Calvert-Lewin, 76 mins\" \"\"\")"
