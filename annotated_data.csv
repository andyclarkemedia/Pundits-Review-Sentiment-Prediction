Kimmich's excellent strike shortly before the break opened up a seven-point lead at the top as Dortmund's young guns failed to trouble their experienced opponents,Joshua Kimmich,1
 A fine chip from Joshua Kimmich settled the Bundesliga's biggest game since the return of the German top-flight,Joshua Kimmich,2

Kimmich beat Roman Burki with a superb lofted effort just before half-time at an empty Signal Iduna Park,Joshua Kimmich,2
 although the home goalkeeper will feel that he should have done better.,,0
The goal came at the end of a lively first period between Germany's top two,,1
 in which both sides saw efforts cleared off the line.,,1
But it was Bayern's superior quality which ended up winning the day,,2
 and they could have extended the lead late on when Robert Lewandowski struck the post.,,1
The victory ensures that Hansi Flick's side are now seven points clear at the top of the table with just six games left to play.,,1
Here are the game's talking points.,,1
No-one has quite been here before,,1
 but if you had to trust one football team to adapt to pretty much any situation then it might well be Bayern Munich.,,2
On a football occasion that the word 'eerie' could have been invented for,,1
 the 29-time German champions overcame a strong start from their hosts to slowly begin to strangle the life from the game,,1
 and when that happens in your empty home stadium then you are sure to start to feel more than a little lonely.,,1
Bayern didn't allow the Dortmund full-backs to assert their usual attacking authority,,1
 and there became a sense of masters and apprentices about the game - and perhaps the season.,,1
Seven points clear with six games remaining,,1
 so is that it?,,1
Again?,,1
 Ja.,,1
An eighth straight Bundesliga title has now loomed sharply into view for Bayern Munich thanks to Kimmich's chip evading Burki's desperate but doomed grasp.,,1
With more attention on the Budesliga than ever before for obvious reasons then perhaps the authorities would like a closer title race going into the season's final weeks,,1
 but instead they look like getting imperious champions again.,,2
Having taken this huge stride towards the domestic title there will surely be few clubs as determined to resume the Champions League as Bayern,,1
 who could now see the path open up in front of them.,,1
Should the tournament get started again in perhaps July or August then Bayern will have a superior match fitness to their rivals,,2
 with wins such as this one doing wonders for confidence too.,,2
It was Dortmund that they beat the last time they lifted the big trophy at Wembley seven years ago,,1
 and if the league can be wrapped up quickly then all roads could lead to Istanbul.,,1
Or wherever the final ends up being.,,1
As footballers around the world jealously tuned in and longed for a return to the pitch,,1
 it was left to Inter Milan's Romelu Lukaku to sum up everyone's feelings towards Alphonso Davies.,Alphonso Davies,1
The Canadian teenager has been catching the eye on the left of Bayern's defence this season,,2
 and in one of his biggest tests to date he delivered yet another display that showed the very best of the modern full-back.,,2
A player who seems able to run just as fast with the ball as he does without,,1
 at one stage Davies' incredible recovery pace was on show when he got back to stop Erling Haaland from unleashing one of his goal-directed missiles.,Alphonso Davies,2
His is a remarkable story,,2
 and he only looks like getting better.,,2
As for Haaland,Erling Haaland,1
 it just wasn't his night.,,0
An early sight of goal aside,,1
 the Norwegian just didn't look at his best,,0
 and worryingly he left the pitch injured before the end of the game.,,1
He had long since been forced to feed off scraps though,,1
 and this was another occasion that summed up why he has a lot learn as he makes his way at the top level.,,1
It promises to be thrilling to watch him learn though.,,2
UNION BERLIN 0-2 BAYERN MUNICH: Robert Lewandowski's first-half penalty and Benjamin Pavard's second-half header pushed Die Roten back four points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table,,1
 Robert Lewandowski scored,Robert Lewandowski,2

After watching Borussia Dortmund move within a point after their 4-0 thrashing of Schalke in Saturday's Revierderby,,1

Union were well organised but ex-Dortmund defender Neven Subotic's poor touch and lunge on Leon Goretzka five minutes before the break gave Lewandowski the chance from 12 yards.,"Neven Subotic, Robert Lewandowski",1
The Polish hitman made no mistake,,1
 notching his 40th goal in just 34 appearances in all competitions this term.,,1

From that point Bayern dominate,,2

" ""For the first game back after so long",,1
 it was good,,2
""" declared Germany midfielder Julian Brandt",Julian Brandt,1
 having played a starring role in Borussia Dortmund's Revierderby victory over Schalke.,,2
It was a sentiment which will be echoed by football fans across the globe,,1
 as one of Europe's most popular leagues returned to action after a two month absence.,,1
With a strict health protocol governing the fragile restart,,1
 including no fans and strict social distancing measures,,1
 it was always going to be interesting to see precisely what was on offer.,,1
"""You score and nothing happens",,1
""" was how Dortmund boss Lucien Favre rather neatly summed up part of the compromise at the Westfalenstadion.",,1
His players still managed to pay tribute to absent supporters mind,,1
 applauding the vacant yellow wall post-game.,,1
But this was certainly,,1
 viewing from afar,,1
 a major step forwards to getting back to normal - perhaps not just where football itself is concerned.,,1
With all that being said,,1
 here's a look at eight talking points on the Bundesliga's return...,,1
The norm on the touchline is usually to see the substitutes cuddled up together on the bench behind their coaches,,1
 having a good chat or watching the game.,,1
They were still able to do the latter two things,,1
 only this time while sticking to social distancing rules,,1
 two metres apart.,,1
This photo says it all‚Ä¶,,1
 Ball boys wearing gloves.,,1
Match balls disinfected pre-game and at half-time.,,1
Never have footballs been so gloriously well protected.,,2
Yes it‚Äôs not the same without the noise of fans coming through your TV screen.,,1
It‚Äôs not going to be is it,,1
 given this is,,1
 effectively,,1
 a compromise amid the ongoing global situation.,,1
And while it does take away from the experience somewhat - particularly when such vocal,,1
 occasionally rambunctious supporters' groups are missing - what it does allow you is to be able to hear more clearly what coaches are shouting,,1
 or what the players are saying to one another.,,1
The latter is especially noticeable,,1
 maybe even welcome,,2
 when there‚Äôs a little bit of aggro at certain moments - for example,,1
 when Schalke‚Äôs Jean-Clair Todibo told Erling Haaland to ‚ÄúGo f*** your grandmother‚Äù at a corner.,,0
Shortly after Todibo‚Äôs retort,,1
 the Norwegian notched the first goal on the Bundesliga‚Äôs return,,1
 picking up where he left off.,,1
The ex-Red Bull Salzburg striker found the net with a first time finish after being found with a delicious cross by Thorgan Hazard.,Thorgan Hazard,2
He‚Äôs now scored 10+ goals in three competitions this season: Germany‚Äôs Bundesliga,,1
 Austria‚Äôs Bundesliga,,1
 and the Champions League.,,1
Todibo meanwhile,,1
 on loan from Barcelona,,1
 went off at half-time with an injury.,,1
as Dortmund,,1
 for whom Jadon Sancho was just a sub,Jadon Sancho,1
 romped to victory.,,2
The Video Assistant Referee made its presence felt on football's resumption too,,1
 most notably in Leipzig.,,1
RBL had batter Freiburg in the second half,,1
 having fallen behind in the first period,,1
 but only had Yussuf Poulsen's terrific headed equaliser to show for their domination.,,2
Then,,1
 in a game they'll argue they should have won,,1
 they looked set to lose after being caught out at a set piece in injury time.,,0
Unfortunately for the side from the Black Forest,,0
 Robin Koch was inches offside - and VAR simply doesn't miss such things.,,1
You can imagine that Dedryck Boyata and Hertha will be receiving a phone call from the DFL this week,,1
 offering the Belgian a reminder.,,1
Because amid the masks and the social distancing going on across the country - yes,,1
 obviously you can't really do it on the pitch - he appeared to decide to kiss Marko Grujic in the 3-0 win at Hoffenheim.,,1
Now,,1
 I assume he'll offer the plea when summoned that he was merely whispering some sort of plan he wanted to put into place at a future corner - what run he wanted to make,,1
 who he wanted blocked - or something to the Liverpool loanee.,,1
But at a time where players emerged from the tunnel wearing protective face masks and there were no handshakes or pre-game photographs,,1
 expect him to be asked a question or two.,,1
Anyway the DFL have confirmed he won't be sanctioned,,1
" a spokesman stating: ""On the subject of goal celebrations",,1
 it was something that was merely advised in the guidelines - sanctions are therefore not necessary.,,1
"""",,1
 First players just shook hands.,,1
Gradually over time it became all about the hand clasp,,1
 the high five with pals and swapping shirts.,,1
Now,,1

 Wolves boss Nuno again criticised the decision to play pre-match,,1

Wolves had lobbied UEFA to postpone the game - an appeal which was rejected - after Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis announced on Tuesday he had tested positive for coronavirus.,,1
None of the Olympiakos squad showed up with the virus when they were tested earlier in the week,,1
 but Wolves were baffled at being forced to take what they thought was an unnecessary risk.,,0
Roma's trip to Sevilla and Inter Milan's game with Getafe were already off but Wolves made the trip to Athens reluctantly.,,1
The game was already being played behind closed doors because of the Covid-19 outbreak,,1
 although around 40 vocal guests of the hosts made themselves heard.,,1
There was little early action for the few in the stadium aside from Mathieu Valbuena's early free-kick flying straight at Rui Patricio.,Mathieu Valbuena,1
The game was played at pre-season pace - Wolves looking like they wanted to be anywhere in the world but Athens - yet they were given a boost after 28 minutes when Olympiacos were reduced to 10 men.,,1
The visitors broke quickly and,,1
 as Diogo Jota darted towards the box,Diogo Jota,1
 he was taken out by Semedo.,Ruben Semedo,0
The defender was immediately dismissed by referee Clement Turpin and Ruben Neves' subsequent free-kick was deflected over.,,0

Adama Traore dragged wide just before the break but Wolves fell behind nine minutes into the second half.,Adama Traore,1
Valbuena cut inside to find space and play in Guilherme,"Mathieu Valbuena, Guilherme Torres",1

The midfielder left Conor Coady standing and then crossed for El Arabi - who scored to knock Arsenal out in the last round - to tap in from six yards.,El Arabi,1
The striker has now scored in four of his last five appearances for Olympiakos in the Champions League and Europa League.,,2
Wolves responded and Jose Sa saved smartly from Raul Jimenez after he was slipped in by Neto before Neves curled wide from distance.,,1
Nuno's side had rarely looked a threat before then but they grabbed a fortunate leveller after 67 minutes.,,1
Joao Moutinho touched on a free-kick and Neto's 25-yard low drive flicked off Andreas Bouchalakis to wrong-foot Sa and earn Wolves a crucial away goal.,João Moutinho,1

And Mason Greenwood and Andreas Pereira added to the lead in injury time to kill off any hopes LASK may have had for the second leg.,"Mason Greenwood, Andreas Pereira",1
The game often felt flat without the fans,,0
 however,,1
 and it is unfortunately something that may turn into a common occurrence over the coming weeks.,,0
Here are five things we learned from the encounter...,,1
This was the first time this season a Premier League side has played behind closed doors,,1
 but it certainly won't be the last.,,1
With the coronavirus pandemic wreaking havoc to the sporting calendar,,1
 games all around Europe look set to go ahead without supporters in the stadium,,1
 unless the sport is suspended altogether.,,1
To put it bluntly,,1
 tonight just wasn't football.,,0
Without the chants of the supporters,,1
" the wild celebrations for goals and the ""ooh"" and ""err"" sounds we all associate with the sport",,1
 the game really lacked something,,0
 and surely there have to be questions over whether occasions like this are worth playing at all if nobody is there to see them.,,1
It felt more like watching a Sunday League team down the park than elite athletes at the top of their game,,0
 and the grey seats in the background were a haunting reminder of what is going on in the world.,,1
"Scottish legend Jock Stein once said ""Football is nothing without fans.""",,1
He wasn't wrong.,,1
We are running out of superlatives to describe Bruno Fernandes after yet another wonderful display from the Portuguese midfielder.,Bruno Fernandes,2
It's quite incredible how one player can have such an effect on a team,,2
 but he again drove his side forward with some brilliant vision and pinpoint passing.,,2
He recorded yet another assist to set up Ighalo for the first goal and ensure he has now scored or made a goal in five of the eight games he has played for the club so far.,,2
Quite simply he makes things happen,,2
 and if he keeps this up United have a very good chance of a really strong end to the season.,,2
It's fair to say the signing of Ighalo wasn't the most popular in United's history at the time,Odion Ighalo,0
 but the Nigerian has gone on to prove an awful lot of people wrong.,,1
The 30-year-old grabbed his fourth goal in United colours,,1
 and displayed some delightfully silky footwork to take the ball past the defender before thumping a strike into the top corner.,,2
Ighalo is proving that he is much more than the target man to lump balls up to that some people had suggested,Odion Ighalo,2
 and if he continues this rich vein of form he could end up being one of the most shrewd signings of the whole season.,,2
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has seemed undecided as to his best centre-back partnership in recent weeks.,,1
Following the return of Eric Bailly from injury the Norwegian has experimented with starting the Ivorian alongside Harry Maguire,"Eric Bailly, Harry Maguire",1
 but Victor Lindelof has still tended to make the line-up in more important games over Bailly.,Victor Lindelöf,1
He did his chances of first-team football no harm with his performance tonight,,2
 however,,1
 and put in a number of important blocks to preserve his side's lead.,,1
It will be intriguing to see whether Solskjaer decides to stick with the same pair in the crucial game against Tottenham this weekend,,1
 or whether he chooses to mix it up again.,,1
The relief on James' face was palpable as he finally ended his barren spell in front of goal with his second half strike.,Daniel James,2
The 22-year-old got off to a brilliant start to the season but has since struggled somewhat,,1
 and this was the first time he has found the back of the net for United since his goal in a 1-1 draw against Southampton at the end of August.,,1
James' confidence appeared to improve as a result of his 58th minute effort,Daniel James,2
 and United will be hoping the goal can give him a boost for the rest of the campaign and that he can keep chipping in with a few more from now on.,,1
Man Utd comfortable saw off LASK 5-0 in Austria to all but ensure progression into the last eight with Odion Ighalo and Dan James on the score sheet,"Odion Ighalo, Daniel James",2
 Manchester United put five past LASK in Austria to seal a comprehensive victory in the Europa League.,,2
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can rest assured his side will be in the quarter-finals provided UEFA choose to keep the competition alive.,,1
Coronavirus fears could curtail this season's tournament and was also the reason United played in an empty stadium.,,1
Odion Ighalo smashed home the opener with a blistering strike that came off the underside of the bar.,Odion Ighalo,2
Dan James ended his goal drought with the second before Juan Mata made it 3-0 thanks to a lovely ball from Fred.,"Daniel James, Juan Mata, Fred",2
Bruno Fernandes was again a star and came off with 20 minutes to go,Bruno Fernandes,2
 but his performance was full of flicks,,1
 tricks and star quality.,,2
Mason Greenwood,,1
 a late introduction,,1
 scored number four before a speculative effort from Andreas Pereira capped a stellar night.,Andreas Pereira,2
LASK failed to have a shot in target as their lack of quality told and Sergio Romero enjoyed a trouble free night in the United goal.,Sergio Romero,1
And that is that.,,1
No fans,,1
 no problem for the visitors.,,2
Goals from Ighalo,Odion Ighalo,1
 James,,1
 Mata,,1
 Greenwood and Pereira mean Man Utd will return home with a 5-0 win.,"Mason Greenwood, Andreas Pereira",2
As clinical as it comes and they can begin planning for the last eight - if the competition hasn‚Äôt been suspended!,,1
Poor from the goalkeeper.,,0
Pereira hits it from 30 odds yards and it is by no means it the corner,Andreas Pereira,1
 perhaps a tiny bit of movement,,1
 but he won‚Äôt care.,,1
A five star performance from the visitors.,,2
The sub gets in on the act and scores his fifth Europa League goal of the season.,,1
Greenwood well found by Chong and smashes it into the near post,"Mason Greenwood, Tahith Chong",2
 it hits both uprights before trickling in.,,1
Four up now and that really is the tie over.,,1
Man Utd effortlessly get the ball forward.,,2
It is excellent play from Bailly who shows great composure in his own box before Chong is fouled in the LASK half.,"Eric Bailly, Tahith Chong",2
We‚Äôll have three minutes of stoppage time here in Austria.,,1
Man Utd just seeing this out now.,,1

Corner now for the hosts.,,1
Final sub for Man Utd as Greenwood replaces Ighalo ,"Mason Greenwood, Odion Ighalo",1
 Man Utd three up and cruising.,,2
It really has been a comfortable night for the visitors and they will continue their unbeaten run in all competitions.,,2
It is too early to suggest they‚Äôve turned the corner under Solskjaer,,1
 but they certainly look like a confident outfit.,,2
Great ball from Fred,Fred,2
 in Fernandes‚Äô absence he‚Äôs stepped up with an excellent pass.,,2
Mata makes a great run from out to in and slots it past the keep.,Juan Mata,2
No chance for the goalkeeper and it just shows the levels between the two sides tonight.,,1
LASK again find themselves in some good areas but just lack that cutting edge.,,0
A cross sees the hosts claim a handball but the ref waves it away and that attacking spell is over.,,1
VAR checking and it doesn‚Äôt take long for them to agree with the ref.,,1
Pereira is Man Utd‚Äôs second change as he comes on to replace Fernandes.,"Andreas Pereira, Bruno Fernandes",1
Another stellar showing.,,2
Best player on the pitch.,,2
Fernandes then follows suit and strikes over from 20 odds yards.,Bruno Fernandes,1
His shot isn‚Äôt at all close,,1
 probably the only bad thing he‚Äôs done all evening.,,1
Klauss fires one from at least 25 yards out but Romero watches it fly wide.,Sergio Romero,1
His manager isn‚Äôt too chuffed with that decision but it just shows how much pressure Man Utd have put them under.,,0
Bailly is up and on his feet!,Eric Bailly,1
Bailly is down and there is a bit of concern from his team-mates.,Eric Bailly,1
The defender has been blighted by injuries since joining so this won‚Äôt be a welcome look with the physio on the pitch.,,1
LASK starting to push a bit here and they spurn their best chance of the game.,,2
Michorl works a good opportunity but blazes over without much pressure on him.,Peter Michorl,1
A missed opportunity.,,0
Chong is Man Utd‚Äôs first sub,Tahith Chong,1
 coming on for James.,Daniel James,1
Man Utd are getting ready to make the changes.,,1
The game is all but done with ten minutes to go so why risk things with a top four battle to think about as well.,,1
Williams gives it away in a poor position and for a minute it looked as if LASK were in.,Brandon Williams,0
Maguire cleans up though and Man Utd are back in possession.,Harry Maguire,1
LASK look out of ideas,,0
 in truth they didn‚Äôt have too many at the start anyway.,,2

Man Utd playing with so much confidence now.,,2
You‚Äôd be shocked if they didn‚Äôt score at least one more.,,1
James especially looks like a new man following his goal.,Daniel James,2
Ighalo hits the post following a clever ball!,Odion Ighalo,2
A foul on James is required to stop Man Utd breaking.,Daniel James,1
It gives them a free-kick in a great position but Ighalo isn‚Äôt happy he didn‚Äôt receive the ball earlier... ,Odion Ighalo,1
 The Welshman find himself in plenty of space.,,1
He drives forward and cuts inside past a defender before smashing a right-footed shot into the bottom corner.,,2
His goal drought is finally over!,,2
Wasteful from Man Utd.,,0

James to his left,Daniel James,1
 Ighalo to the right but in the end a poor touch sees the ball trickle out.,Odion Ighalo,0
The game is rather scrappy in the opening ten minutes.,,0

Alvaro Morata capped the comeback by scoring the winner on the night in the dying minutes.,Alvaro Morata,2
Here are five taking points from Anfield...,,1
Given the hysteria of Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner and Divock Origi's winner against Barcelona last season - it's easy to forget it was Gini Wijnaldum that turned the game on its head.,Gini Wijnaldum,2
He scored two goals in as many minutes - the second of which a brilliant header - and he repeated the feat here to threaten another comeback.,,2
